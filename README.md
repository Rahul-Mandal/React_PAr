# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Create a context light mode and dark mode

const ThemeContext = createContext();
This context will store the current theme and the function to toggle it.




## Create a Provider component:

Define a ThemeProvider component that wraps its children with the ThemeContext.Provider. Inside ThemeProvider, use the useState hook to manage the theme state, initialized to "light".
Define a toggleTheme function that switches the theme b/w "light" and "dark".

## Provide Context Values:

Pass the theme state and toggleTheme function as the value of the ThemeContext.Provider.
This allows any child component to access and manipulate the theme.

## Consume the Context in a Component::

In the DarkLight component, use the use hook to consume the ThemeContext. Destructure the theme and toggleTheme from the context.

## Apply Conditional Styling:

Use conditional class names to appl different styles based on the theme value.
Adjust the background color, text color and button label according to the current theme.

## Toggle the theme:

Attach the toggleTheme function to a button's onClick event.
This allows the user to switch between light and dark mode by click button
